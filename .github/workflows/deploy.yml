# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to VPS on Main Push

# Required GitHub Secrets:
# - VPS_HOST: Hostname/IP of your VPS server
# - VPS_SSH_USER: SSH username for VPS access
# - VPS_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: SSH private key (RAW content, NOT base64) used for SSH connection
# - VPS_DEPLOY_PATH: Absolute path to the root of your checked-out git repository on the VPS (e.g., /home/deploy/raffley)
# - VPS_GIT_BRANCH: The branch to pull on the VPS (usually 'main')
# - VPS_SERVICE_NAME: The name of the systemd service for your app (e.g., raffley.service)

# Important VPS Prerequisites:
# 1. Git must be installed on the VPS.
# 2. The repository must be cloned in VPS_DEPLOY_PATH.
# 3. The VPS must have network access to clone/pull from GitHub (e.g., SSH key configured if private repo).
# 4. Elixir, Erlang (installed via kerl/manual methods), Node.js (if needed), and build tools (like make, gcc) must be installed on the VPS.
# 5. The PATH for the VPS_SSH_USER must be configured correctly (e.g., in ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile) to find the installed Erlang/Elixir executables (erl, mix, elixir).
# 6. Runtime secrets (DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY_BASE, etc.) must be configured on the VPS environment where the build/run occurs (e.g., in the systemd service file or environment files).
# 7. The VPS_SSH_USER must have passwordless sudo privileges specifically for the systemctl command to restart the service (e.g., configure via /etc/sudoers.d/).
